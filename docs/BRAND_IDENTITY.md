## Brand Essence

### Core Philosophy

**"Share art, not files"**

Galerly exists at the intersection of artistry and technology. The brand transforms photography sharing from a technical file-transfer process into an emotional, beautiful experience. Every interaction should feel crafted, considered, and elegant—never rushed, generic, or transactional.

### Brand Personality

- **Elegant** but not pretentious
- **Simple** but not simplistic  
- **Professional** but not cold
- **Modern** but not trendy
- **Direct** but not blunt
- **Confident** but not arrogant

### Audience Focus

**Primary:** Professional photographers who care deeply about how their work is presented  
**Secondary:** Photography clients who experience galleries as viewers and downloaders  
**Tone toward both:** Respectful, honest, straightforward

---

## Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

#### Direct & Honest
- Short sentences. No fluff.
- Say what it is. Mean what you say.
- "Drag. Drop. Done." not "Simply drag and effortlessly drop your files"
- "Your work stays yours." not "We provide industry-leading intellectual property protection"

#### Confident & Understated
- Let the work speak. Don't oversell.
- "Clean lines. Full resolution." not "Amazing revolutionary gallery design"
- "Time is precious." not "We save you so much valuable time"
- State facts. Avoid hype.

#### Human & Approachable
- Write like a skilled craftsperson talking to another craftsperson
- "We're here to help." not "Our customer success team is standing by"
- "Questions? Ask us anything." not "For inquiries, please consult our comprehensive FAQ"
- Natural rhythm. Conversational but not casual.

#### Aspirational but Grounded
- "Your artistry deserves this." (aspirational)
- "Upload fast. Download faster." (grounded in reality)
- Balance emotion with function
- Never promise what you can't deliver

### Tone Across Contexts

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Marketing** | Inspiring, elegant | "Where moments become memories" |
| **Product Features** | Clear, functional | "Upload in seconds. Full resolution preserved." |
| **Help & Support** | Warm, patient | "Tell us what issue you're experiencing" |
| **Legal/Privacy** | Direct, transparent | "We do NOT sell your data." |
| **Error Messages** | Helpful, blame-free | "Something went wrong. Let's try again." |
| **Success States** | Encouraging, brief | "Gallery shared. Your link is ready." |

## Writing Style

### Sentence Structure

**Short. Punchy. Deliberate.**

Good examples from the codebase:
- "Imagine. Create. Share."
- "Real moments."
- "Speed. Simply Works."
- "Your photography, beautifully presented."

### Punctuation Patterns

#### Period Power
Use periods to create rhythm and emphasis:
- "Clean lines. Full resolution. Nothing but your work."

#### Em Dash for Flow
Use em dashes (—) for elegant connections:
- "DESIGNED FOR YOU — FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS"
- "QUESTIONS — WE HAVE ANSWERS"
- "Stay — Connected"

#### Bullets (•) for Lists in Marketing
- "Quick answers • Just launched • More questions?"
- "We're here to help • Quick response • Support team ready"

#### No Exclamation Points
Never use exclamation points except in rare, genuinely exciting moments.  
Enthusiasm shows through word choice, not punctuation.

### Capitalization

#### ALL CAPS for Section Headers
- "DESIGNED FOR YOU"
- "HOW IT WORKS"

- **Your** (not the user's, the photographer's)
- **Simply** (not easily, effortlessly)
- **Beautiful** (not amazing, awesome, stunning)
- **Fast** (not quick, rapid, speedy)
- **Yours** (ownership, control)
- **Moments** (not shots, pictures)

#### Avoided Words (from user rules)
All corporate jargon forbidden:
- Never: leverage, utilize, optimize, streamline, synergy
- Never: seamless, powerful, revolutionary, game-changing
- Never: robust, scalable, enterprise-grade
- Never: solutions, ecosystem, journey (unless literal journey)

#### Language of Photography

## Forbidden Language

### Never Use

From user rules, these words/phrases are strictly forbidden:

- Tech jargon outside docs: optimize, streamline, scalable
- Redundancy: "various different," "completely finish"

### Why
These words:
- Sound insincere and corporate
- Undermine trust with photographers
- Add no real meaning
- Make copy longer without adding value

### Replace With

| Instead of... | Use... |
|--------------|--------|
| "Leverage our platform" | "Use Galerly" |
| "Seamless experience" | "Simple. Fast." |
| "Powerful tools" | "Tools that work." |

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Copywriters

1. **Read the codebase examples** - The best brand voice is already in the existing pages
2. **Write short first drafts** - Then make them shorter
3. **Remove adjectives** - Most aren't needed
4. **Trust periods** - They create rhythm and impact
5. **Read aloud** - If it sounds corporate, rewrite it

### For Designers

1. **Let photography be the star** - Brand is the frame, not the picture
2. **Use space generously** - Cramped = cheap
3. **Stick to the system** - SF Pro fonts, blue buttons, glass effects
4. **Test on real photography** - Not stock photos
5. **Mobile-first** - Most photographers check on phone

### For Developers

1. **Loading states matter** - "Loading your galleries..." not "Loading..."
2. **Error messages** - Helpful, not "Error 404"
3. **Empty states** - Encouraging, not blank
4. **Success feedback** - Brief confirmation, not modal
5. **Keep UI text short** - If it doesn't fit, it's too long

### For Support Team

1. **Never copy-paste templates** - Personalize every response
2. **Use photographer's name** - They're people, not tickets
3. **Assume competence** - They're professionals
4. **Be honest** - If you don't know, say so
5. **Follow up** - Close the loop
