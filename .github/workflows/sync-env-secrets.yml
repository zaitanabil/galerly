name: Sync Environment Secrets

# NOTE: This workflow is designed to run LOCALLY only
# It requires .env.production file which is not committed to the repository
# 
# To use this workflow:
# 1. Run locally: python .github/scripts/generate-env-config.py
# 2. Review the generated commands in .github/generated/gh-commands.sh
# 3. Execute manually if desired
#
# This workflow is kept for documentation purposes but will fail in CI/CD
