+ fix the downloadSelectedBtn button because clicking it currently does nothing. remove any logic related to downloading selected pictures because we no longer offer that feature. we only keep one download option which is the download all button. ensure that the zip file containing all images is always pre-generated and stored in aws. every time the photographer uploads or removes photos, the zip file must be regenerated and updated in aws. when the user clicks the download all button the download must trigger immediately without additional processing.
- no image format must be blocked during upload; all image formats must be accepted. all uploaded images must be downloadable exactly as originally uploaded, with no modification, processing, or compression. all images must be displayed in the ui using s3 + cloudfront with url-based transformations. do not use placeholders for raw, dng, or any other image formats; every uploaded image must appear directly in the ui.
+ update the share pop up design to better reflect the guidelines described in BRAND-IDENTITY.md. the pop up must be fully aligned with the brand identity, visually consistent, compact, and easy to understand. it must never require scrolling on any device; the layout must automatically adapt to all screen sizes. ensure the design is clean, space-efficient, and fits entirely within the visible area on all screens.
+ in the viewer mode (client not signed in), add a CTA button inside a black hero section placed right before the footer. this hero section must follow the same design style, structure, and layout as the first hero sections used across all pages, ensuring full visual consistency with existing hero components. the CTA must clearly address both audiences: clients and photographers. it must be easy for a regular client, a photographer, or a client who wants to share photos with family or friends to immediately understand the action they can take. the button text and context must make the purpose unambiguous for all user types.
- remove different register choice (photographer and client), everyone can sign in, but you need to add a toggle (photographer/Client), so that also photographers can have galleries that other photographers share with them. and also a client can share photos with his friends or someone else.
- the expiration must be fixed.
- add tiktok link in all pages.
